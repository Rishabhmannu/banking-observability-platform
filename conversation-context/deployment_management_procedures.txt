PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION PROCEDURES
===================================

AUTO-BASELINING OPTIMIZATION:
1. Data Collection Period:
   - Initial: 1-2 hours for basic recommendations
   - Optimal: 24+ hours for high-confidence thresholds
   - Maximum efficiency: 7+ days of historical data

2. Algorithm Performance Tuning:
   - Monitor algorithm_performance metrics
   - Adjust confidence thresholds based on use case
   - Use ensemble recommendations for production

3. Resource Optimization:
   - Memory: ~200MB per service
   - CPU: Low baseline, periodic spikes during calculation
   - Network: Prometheus query frequency configurable

MONITORING & ALERTING PROCEDURES
================================

PROMETHEUS MONITORING:
Key Metrics to Watch:
- up{job="auto-baselining"} - Service availability
- threshold_recommendations - Active threshold values
- threshold_confidence - Algorithm reliability
- baselining_calculations_total - Processing activity

GRAFANA DASHBOARD MONITORING:
1. Banking System Overview:
   - Service health status
   - Request/error rates
   - System performance trends

2. Auto-Baselining Dashboard:
   - Algorithm status and performance
   - Threshold recommendations timeline
   - Confidence score trends

3. DDoS Detection Dashboard:
   - Attack detection status
   - ML model performance
   - Security event timeline

ALERT CONFIGURATION:
File: prometheus/alert_rules.yml
- ServiceDown: Critical service unavailability
- HighErrorRate: Performance degradation
- LowAlgorithmPerformance: ML algorithm issues
- BaselineCalculationFailure: Threshold calculation problems

MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES
======================

REGULAR MAINTENANCE TASKS:

DAILY:
- Check system_status.sh output
- Verify all services healthy
- Review Grafana dashboards for anomalies

WEEKLY:
- Review threshold recommendation accuracy
- Check Docker Hub image updates

TROUBLESHOOTING PROCEDURES
==========================

COMMON ISSUES & SOLUTIONS:

1. AUTO-BASELINING SERVICE NOT RESPONDING:
   Diagnosis: curl http://localhost:5002/health
   Solutions:
   - Check Docker logs: docker-compose logs auto-baselining
   - Restart service: docker-compose restart auto-baselining
   - Verify Prometheus connectivity: curl http://localhost:9090/api/v1/targets

2. EMPTY THRESHOLD RECOMMENDATIONS:
   Diagnosis: curl http://localhost:5002/threshold-recommendations
   Solutions:
   - Wait for data collection (1-2 hours minimum)
   - Generate test traffic: ./generate_test_data.sh
   - Check Prometheus data availability

3. LOW ALGORITHM CONFIDENCE:
   Diagnosis: Check confidence scores in API responses
   Solutions:
   - Allow more data collection time
   - Use ensemble recommendations
   - Review algorithm-specific requirements

4. GRAFANA DASHBOARDS MISSING:
   Diagnosis: Check http://localhost:3000
   Solutions:
   - Run ./restore_dashboards.sh
