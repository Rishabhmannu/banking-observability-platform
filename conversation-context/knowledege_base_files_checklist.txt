STEP 2: Start your next conversation with:
"I'm continuing my DDoS Detection & Auto-Baselining internship project. Both Phase 1 and Phase 2 are completed and deployed to Docker Hub as rishabhkumar2003/ddos-detection-banking-*. Please refer to the knowledge base documents I've uploaded for full context: PROJECT_OVERVIEW_COMPLETE.txt, TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE_DETAILED.txt, DEPLOYMENT_MANAGEMENT_PROCEDURES.txt, and NEXT_CONVERSATION_CONTEXT.txt."

STEP 3: Mention what you want to work on next:
- Dynamic alert rule generation
- Cloud deployment (AWS/Azure/GCP)
- Advanced analytics dashboard
- Performance optimization
- Enhanced security features
- Or any other area you're interested in

KEY INFORMATION TO ALWAYS MENTION:

QUICK VERIFICATION COMMANDS FOR NEXT CONVERSATION:
=================================================

IF SYSTEM IS RUNNING:
curl http://localhost:5002/health
curl http://localhost:5002/threshold-recommendations

IF SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE STARTED:
./quick_deploy_from_hub.sh
# OR #
docker-compose -f docker-compose.hub.yml up -d

SYSTEM STATUS CHECK:
./system_status.sh

WHAT NOT TO REPEAT IN NEXT CONVERSATION:
=======================================

✅ DON'T re-explain the basic setup (it's complete)
✅ DON'T re-build the basic architecture (it's deployed)  
✅ DON'T re-create the core services (they're in Docker Hub)
✅ DON'T re-implement Phase 1 or Phase 2 (both completed)

WHAT TO FOCUS ON IN NEXT CONVERSATION:
=====================================

✅ DO choose next enhancement/feature to implement
✅ DO leverage existing deployed infrastructure
✅ DO build upon the completed foundation
✅ DO aim for advanced/professional features
✅ DO prepare for internship presentation

CONVERSATION SUCCESS INDICATORS:
===============================

The assistant should:
✅ Immediately recognize the completed project status
✅ Reference the knowledge base documents appropriately  
✅ Suggest next-level enhancements (not basic setup)
✅ Understand the current Docker Hub deployment
✅ Know about the 4 ML algorithms already implemented
✅ Be aware of the complete monitoring stack

PERFECT CONTINUATION TOPICS:
===========================

ADVANCED FEATURES:
- Dynamic Prometheus alert generation
- Cloud platform deployment (K8s, AWS, etc.)
- Executive analytics dashboard
- Real-time threat intelligence integration
- Advanced ML model optimization

PROFESSIONAL ENHANCEMENTS:
