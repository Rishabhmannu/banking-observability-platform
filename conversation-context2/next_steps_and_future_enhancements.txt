=== ARCHITECTURE EVOLUTION ===

Phase 1 (Current):
- Monolithic docker-compose
- Local development focus
- Mock data generation

Phase 2 (Next):
- Kubernetes deployment
- Helm charts
- GitOps workflow
- Real data sources

Phase 3 (Future):
- Multi-cluster setup
- Edge computing nodes
- Serverless components
- AI-driven operations

=== LEARNING RESOURCES ===

1. Distributed Tracing:
   - OpenTelemetry documentation
   - Jaeger getting started guide
   - Trace context propagation

2. Advanced Prometheus:
   - PromQL mastery
   - Recording rules
   - Federation setup
   - Long-term storage

3. Kubernetes Operations:
   - Operator pattern
   - Custom resources
   - Service mesh
   - GitOps practices

=== PROJECT HANDOVER NOTES ===

For continuing this project:
1. All code is in respective service directories
2. Configuration files in prometheus/ and grafana/
3. Docker compose files define entire infrastructure
4. Shell scripts automate common operations
5. Backups preserve state between sessions

Key files to review:
- docker-compose.yml (main services)
- docker-compose.transaction-monitoring.yml (monitoring addon)
- prometheus/prometheus.yml (scrape configs)
- Each service's app.py (business logic)
- Shell scripts (operations)

Testing approach:
1. Start with system_status3.sh
2. Generate traffic
3. Test anomalies
4. Observe dashboards
5. Validate detection
